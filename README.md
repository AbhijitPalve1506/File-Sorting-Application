# File-Sorting-Application
 The File Sorting Application is a Tkinter-based tool that organizes mixed files within a folder. Upon providing the folder path, it categorizes files by extension, creating folders for each type (e.g., Documents, Images) and moving files accordingly. Built with Tkinter and the OS library, it simplifies file management for diverse file types.
